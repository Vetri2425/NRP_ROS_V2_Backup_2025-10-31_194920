# 🚀 Quick Start: Push to GitHub

## ⚡ Fastest Method

1. **Create the repository on GitHub**:
   ```
   https://github.com/new
   ```
   - Repository name: `NRP_ROS_V2_Backup_2025-10-31_194920`
   - Description: `Backup of NRP ROS V2 Frontend Project - Created on 2025-10-31`
   - Make it **Private** (recommended) or Public

2. **Run the automated script**:
   ```powershell
   .\push_to_github.ps1
